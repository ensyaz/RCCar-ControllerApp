# RCCar-ControllerApp
RCCar 's code is written in Arduino and the controller app is designed by Android Studio. Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) 
for Android application development.  When pressing to buttons, app sends data to RC Car 's bluetooth module to move the car. If repo wants to transform to 
apk directly via Android Studio, need to remove the RCCar file.
